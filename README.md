# AFSP-Model-Comparison

This is an ongoing analysis on choosing the best model through for the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/afsis-soil-properties/overview">African Soil Prediction Kaggle Competition</a>. 

Update 1 (08/20/2019): 
The support vector machine model definitely shows better performance over using a gradient boost regressor. I will continue to go down this route, increasing the number of iterations over time as well as continuing to use the cross validation scoring function to tally scores.
